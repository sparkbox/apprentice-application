  <h1 class="info-header">What You&rsquo;ll be doing</h1>
  <p class="info-secondary">In the first months of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be exposed to the core technologies of our work and work flow. Everyone, regardless of job title, will be brought to an understanding of Sparkbox&rsquo;s convictions on the priority of content, value of design, semantic HTML, and mobile-first CSS. You&rsquo;ll be exposed to our Github-centric project management, our deployment processes, best practices for clean code and separation of concerns, and unit testing techniques.</p>
  <p class="info-secondary">By the end of your apprenticeship, you&rsquo;ll be interacting as a full-fledged team member. Your confidence will be up, you&rsquo;ll have some work under your belt, and that&rsquo;s when the real fun begins.</p>
  <p class="info-secondary">Check out our <a href="https://github.com/sparkbox/apprenticeships">apprenticeship GitHub repository</a> to get a really good sense of what you&rsquo;ll be doing.</p>
